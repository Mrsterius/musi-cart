trapnation

themes for artwork - image to video -> themes

    -> image -> themes / generated image
    -> image 2 video = understanding harmonies -> creating transitions

    -> water, ripples in the water, nature

we need a model which can learn novel representations 

selection of themes -> windows media player visualizations

Flow :-
first login -> select artists -> select songs (like/dislike) -> signature detection -> profile frequency spectrum (Profile) -> multimodal -> CLIP similarity search
select mood -> recommend songs with videos with particular frequencies 

two tower model

can generate a static picture 3d scenic walkthrough -> model

specific song templates - astronaut in the ocean
river flows in you - different colours streams moving, piano
biopolar sunshine - daydreamer
shivers

Paveethran :-

1. data -> features -> generating visuals -> preanalysing

2. dynamic -> random -> improve as the song goes on
lightweight analysis, global attention mask


indexes - quora system design topics -> each song - happy, sad
inverted index -> top similar matching from that particular emotion -> show him that visual

maintaing flow ->
song a -> high beat tempo -> likes
song b -> medium beat tempo -> 


real time simulation based on similar states/flow

global attention mask -> sentiment
local attention -> 

autoregressive encoder decoder
